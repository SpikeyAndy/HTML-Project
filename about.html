		<h2>Welcome to About Me!</h2>
		<p>This is where I explain who I am</p>
		<h6>(most information below are untrue)</h6>
		<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		 <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Andy and I am currently a student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, pursuing a dual degree program in Computer Engineering and Marketing.</p>
		 <p>From a young age, I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and business. As I grew older, I realized that my passion for these two fields was not only a passing interest, but something that I wanted to pursue as a career.</p>
		 <p>My journey in studying both Computer Engineering and Marketing has been both challenging and rewarding. 
		 <p>On one hand, studying Computer Engineering has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of how technology works and how it can be applied to solve real-world problems. On the other hand, studying Marketing has given me a unique perspective on how businesses operate and how they can leverage technology to innovate and create value for their customers.</p>
		 <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I am an avid reader and enjoy exploring different genres of literature. I also love to travel and experience new cultures, which has allowed me to gain a broader perspective on the world and the people in it. Additionally, I am passionate about music and have played the guitar for several years.</p>
		 <p>Throughout my academic and personal experiences, I have developed a strong set of skills, including critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and creativity. I am excited to continue developing these skills and applying them in my future career.</p>
		 <p>Thank you for visiting my webpage and taking the time to learn more about me. Please feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out to me if you have any questions or if you are interested in collaborating on a project.</p>
